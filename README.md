Tat Tvam Asi
Welcome to Tat Tvam Asi, my personal website dedicated to sharing spiritual thoughts, insights on various spiritual leaders, and more topics related to spirituality.
The phrase "Tat Tvam Asi" is a Sanskrit expression which translates to "Thou Art That" â€“ a profound statement on the unity of the individual with the absolute.
Thankyou
